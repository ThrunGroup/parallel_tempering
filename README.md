# parallel_tempering

Using parallel tempering may improve the overall loss for k-medoids. We're comparing the usage of parallel tempering and the in-built Pypi package that outputs the overall loss directly.

For the data, it's currently randomly generated and this data generation is also a part of the `parallel_tempering_k_medoids.ipynb` file.
